# NYC AirBnB Market
A Notebook Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market 

# Objective 
In the Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market project, I will apply data importing and cleaning skills to analyze the Airbnb market in New york. I will ingest and combine the data from multiple file types, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.

The project is perfect for beginners who want to get data importing and cleaning experience. The goal is to get even better at handling and processing the data.
